## The Problem

> *"On October 30, 1884, British authorities opened fire on a peaceful Hosay procession in San Fernando. 22 people died, 120+ were wounded. It's one of the bloodiest events in Trinidad's colonial history.*
>
> *Most Trinis have never heard of it."*

Trinidad & Tobago is home to **over 20 cultural festivals** spanning African, Indian, Indigenous, European, and Chinese heritage. These festivals represent centuries of tradition, survival, and cultural fusion that make T&T unique in the Caribbean.

**But most people only know Carnival.**

The information about these festivals is:
- **Scattered** across Facebook groups, outdated government sites, and academic archives
- **Inaccessible** to first-timers who don't know the etiquette, dress codes, or what to expect
- **Invisible** to the diaspora trying to reconnect with their heritage
- **Missing** from tourist experiences seeking authenticity beyond the beach

## The Gap in the Market

| What Exists | The Problem |
|:------------|:------------|
| WahWeDoing.com | 300+ Carnival parties, zero indigenous festivals |
| VisitTrinidad.tt | Last updated 2020 |
| DiscoverTnT.com | Calendar frozen on 2020 |
| NALIS archives | Excellent content, buried in academic format |
| Facebook groups | Fragmented, unsearchable, no context for newcomers |

**No platform exists that helps someone attend a festival they've never been to.**

People don't just need to know *when* a festival happens. They need to know *what it is*, *what to expect*, and *how to participate respectfully*.

## Our Solution

A platform that serves as a **first-timer's guide** to every major cultural festival in Trinidad & Tobago.

### What We're Building

- **Festival Calendar** — Browse all festivals by month, region, or heritage type
- **First-Timer's Guides** — Deep, accessible content for each festival:
  - History and cultural significance
  - What you'll actually see, hear, and experience
  - How to participate respectfully (dress code, etiquette, what's appropriate)
  - Practical info (parking, food, best viewing spots)
- **"This Week in T&T Culture"** — What's happening soon, with email digests
- **Community Memories** — Real stories from people who've attended
- **Email Reminders** — Get notified before festivals you care about
- **PWA** — Works offline (for when you're at a festival with bad signal)

## Why This Matters

### Cultural Preservation

Trinidad & Tobago's cultural landscape is extraordinary:

- **First Peoples Heritage** — The Santa Rosa First Peoples Community in Arima is the last organized Indigenous group in T&T, preserving traditions from 8,000+ years of continuous Amerindian presence
- **Hosay** — A solemn Islamic observance brought by Indian indentured laborers in 1845, with tadjahs reaching 30 feet tall
- **Divali Nagar** — The largest Divali celebration in the English-speaking Caribbean
- **Spiritual Baptist Liberation Day** — Commemorating the 1951 repeal of the Shouter Prohibition Ordinance that had banned the faith for 34 years

These traditions risk fading from public consciousness when they're not documented and shared accessibly.

### Diaspora Connection

**374,500 Trinbagonians** live abroad in the USA, Canada, and UK. Many are disconnected from the cultural traditions of their homeland. This platform gives them a way to:
- Learn about festivals their parents and grandparents attended
- Plan meaningful visits home around cultural events
- Share these traditions with the next generation

### Tourism with Authenticity

**158,890 tourists** arrived in T&T between January and May 2025 (up 13.7% year-over-year). The Ministry of Tourism is actively pushing "community-centered experiences" — exactly what our platform enables.

Instead of just beaches and Carnival, tourists can experience:
- Hosay processions in St. James
- Santa Rosa Festival in Arima
- Ramleela performances across 35+ sites
- Phagwa celebrations island-wide
